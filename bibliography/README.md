## Systematic Review Summary

This repository includes a systematic review of publications indexed in the **Scopus** bibliographic database, covering the period from **January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2024**. Scopus is recognized as one of the most comprehensive academic databases. 

### Search Strategy

The search was performed using only **titles** to reduce noise from an overly broad result set when including abstracts. It was based on the intersection of two sets of keywords:

- **Set 1 (Social Media/Networks):**
  - Keywords: `social media`, `social network`, `online social media (OSM)`, `online social network (OSN)`, `mobile social network (MSN)`, `social networking site (SNS)`, etc.

- **Set 2 (Cyber Threats):**
  - Keywords: `cyber threat`, `attack`, `security`, and variations.

The Scopus query used was:

TITLE(( *social AND ( media OR network* )) OR osn* OR sns OR msn*) 
AND TITLE(*threat* OR *security OR *attack*) 
AND PUBYEAR > 2013 
AND (LIMIT-TO(SUBJAREA, "COMP") OR LIMIT-TO(SUBJAREA, "ENGI"))
